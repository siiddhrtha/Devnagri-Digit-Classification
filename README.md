# Devnagri-Digit-Classification


This project implements a Neural Network for the purpose of digit classification. 
The network contains two hidden layers and is implemented in python by using tensorflow libraries. 
The network parameters are learned though the back-propagation algorithm. MNIST dataset is used to train and test the network. 


I have included the Results and the live demo of the classification and testing of the images
